- This collection includes a set of utilities for Luogu.
- Some utilities that can generally do more things than just for Luogu, will be thought moved to other developing repositories.
- If Luogu is actually ***suffering*** from any utility here, you should ***issue*** it, then I will remove it or make it unavailable.

## File-to-String Converter (F2S)

### Feature

### Status

## Linux Core Version Viewer (LCV)

### Feature
- This viewer **just** ouput the linux core version.

- Developed and maintained.

### Getting started

## Best AK Automata (BAKA) :x:

### Sorry
- Since this brought trouble for Luogu, it has been deprecated and will be **no longer** maintained.
- At first, actually, I just did this for fun. However, bad users made much abuse of it. ***Really sorry*** for Luogu.
- As a result, this automata is **unavailable** now.

### Status
- *Deprecated and no longer maintained.*

### Caveats
> **Please read *CAREFULLY* here.**

- This automata is just for fun for testing problems. Do **NOT** *abuse* it!
- To *abuse* it means one of the following:
    - AC many problems to improve name colors
    - AC many problems in contests to get higher ratings or even prizes
    - Wasting judging resources
    - Many other things disallowed by Luogu...
- Abuse this will make you **BLOCKED** by Luogu administrators.

### Getting started
> **Before starting, you should read *CAREFULLY* about the *CAVEATS* above!**

- Just submit the code in `baka.cpp` and wait for AC.
- *NOTE:* You can **NOT** AC problems that do **NOT** have answer files.

### About
- BAKA v2.1 developed by Polaris1949.
