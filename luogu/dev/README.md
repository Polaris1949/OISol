# Best AK Automata for Luogu (BAKA)

## Sorry
- Since this brought trouble for Luogu, it has been deprecated and will be **no longer** maintained.
- At first, actually, I just did this for fun. However, bad users made much abuse of it. ***Really sorry*** for Luogu.
- As a result, This automata is **unavailable** now.

## Caveats
> **Please read *CAREFULLY* here.**

- This automata is just for fun for testing problems. Do **NOT** *abuse* it!
- To *abuse* it means one of the following:
    - AC many problems to improve name colors
    - AC many problems in contests to get higher ratings or even prizes
    - Wasting judging resources
    - Many other things disallowed by Luogu...
- Abuse this will make you **BLOCKED** by Luogu administrators.

## Getting started
> **Before starting, you should read *CAREFULLY* about the *CAVEATS* above!**

- Just submit the code in `baka.cpp` and wait for AC.
- *NOTE:* You can **NOT** AC problems that do **NOT** have answer files.

## About
- BAKA v2.1 developed by Polaris1949.
